A React Native TextInput with style ðŸ˜Ž

### Installation

`npm install --save reinput`

`yarn add reinput`

### Usage

```js
import Reinput from 'reinput'

const Input = () => (
  <Reinput
  />
)
```

### Props

Coming soon... ðŸ‘€

### Motivation

Styling react-native inputs can be cumbersome. And most of them heavily relies
onto the material design patterns. This style layer over the regular `TextInput`
paves the way towards and easier and faster development.

### Credits

Style patterns are mainly based on [Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/components/text-fields.html#); properly adapted for iOS.

This package was inspired by the abandoned `react-native-md-input`. Including a lot
of the unmerged PR there. And strongly improving the code quality: lint and tests.

Beyond that initial point. You can thanks [@sospedra](https://github.com/sospedra)
